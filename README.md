# Catch-the-Bus
Catch the Bus is a multiplayer puzzle game that is centralized around team-building. Players will
be put in a team of up to 8 and will have to complete various challenges that require teamwork
and coordination in order to pass to the next level. It will be a 2D game, where players can move,
jump, and interact with items in order to reach the end of a level and “catch the bus” to the next
level. Players will not be able to move to the next level unless all of their team members are on
the bus.
